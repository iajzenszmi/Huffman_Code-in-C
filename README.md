Huffman Code in C
This code represents Huffman coding for a set of characters and their associated frequencies. When run, the code will produce Huffman codes for the sample character frequencies provided.

Remember, Huffman codes are built based on the frequency of occurrence of each character, so for different frequencies or character sets, the Huffman codes will differ.
